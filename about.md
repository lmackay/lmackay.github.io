*Welcome to Laura Mackay Photography*

Here at Laura Mackay Photography I aim to capture those special moments specialising in, but not limited to, Nature photography, family and pet portraits, corporate and wedding photography.
I have graduated with my Diploma in photography and aim to give professional and friendly services. I understand that everyone has different thoughts and ideas for what they want and how they want it presented and therefore I do not have any set price packages, so you can get in touch for your unique quote.

If you decide to choose Laura Mackay Photography to capture memories of your wedding it is a good idea but not compulsory that we arrange to meet before your special day to go over details.
